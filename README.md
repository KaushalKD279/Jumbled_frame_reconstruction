🧩 Jumbled Frames Reconstruction Challenge
🎯 Objective

Reconstruct the original 5-second, 1080p, 60 FPS video from a shuffled version (jumbled_video.mp4) by restoring the correct frame order using feature-based similarity analysis.

⚙️ Dependencies

This notebook automatically installs all required dependencies:

opencv-python-headless

torch, torchvision

scikit-learn

tqdm

gdown

🧠 Algorithm Overview

The reconstruction process is based on frame similarity using deep features extracted from a pretrained ResNet-50 model.

Steps:

Frame Extraction – All frames are decoded and stored in memory.

Feature Extraction – Each frame is passed through a pretrained CNN (ResNet-50) to extract 2048-dimensional embeddings.

Similarity Matrix Computation – Cosine similarity is computed between all frame features using GPU acceleration.

Greedy Path Construction – Frames are ordered by iteratively selecting the most similar next frame.

2-opt Local Optimization – A limited 2-opt heuristic refines the frame order for global improvement.

Video Reconstruction – Frames are written sequentially to produce the final output reconstructed.mp4.

🚀 How to Run

Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Run all cells sequentially.

The code will automatically:
